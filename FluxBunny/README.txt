This is a simple program in the MIPS32 language using the MARS integrated development environment. This program will prompt the user for a number. Next, the program will iterate through a set of integers (starting at 0, ending at the number input by the user) and print to the console one of four outputs depending on the number. If the number is evenly divisible by 5 (with no remainder), then the output is “Flux.” If the number is evenly divisible by 7, then the output is “Bunny.” If the number is divisible by both 5 and 7, then the output should be “Flux Bunny”. Lastly, if the output is not divisible by either 5 or 7, then the number itself should be printed.
